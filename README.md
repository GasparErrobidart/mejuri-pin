# Mejuri PIN

First of all, thanks for your time and take this challenge, we really appreciate it!
We gonna try to make this challenge and opportunity to see your skills and also interesting for you.

**The concept**
You are a front end rockstar and Mejuri contacted you to create the next product that will change the world: Mejuri PIN.
The main idea is to create a board like pinterest with all the Mejuri products, and allow the user to like it.
Also the user should be able to list only they liked products and filter the content by category.

Of Course this site should look awesome in mobile! Because everybody loves their phones!
Finally the performance is important, and you are the expert! Please let us know about the strategies that you applied to improve the general performance on the bowser experience.


**Letâ€™s do it**
We included a candidate mockup.png, but is open to your changes.
You can check our current category page here: https://mejuri.com/shop/t/type

All the products in a single endpoint: https://mejuri.com/api/v1/taxon/collections-by-categories/type

The products separated by type:
- Rings: https://mejuri.com/api/v1/taxon/collections-by-categories/type/rings
- Necklaces: https://mejuri.com/api/v1/taxon/collections-by-categories/type/pendants
- Earrings: https://mejuri.com/api/v1/taxon/collections-by-categories/type/earrings
- Bracelets + Anklets: https://mejuri.com/api/v1/taxon/collections-by-categories/type/bracelets

Your app should be able to:
- Read the data from the Json
- Render the products by category and show the name of the products when the user puts the cursor over the product image.
- Save your favorite products and list it
- Filter by category.


**Libraries**
- Please do not use other JS frameworks, such as JQuery, Angular, etc. React is already available for you to use.
- Feel free to use CSS frameworks like Material UI.

**Objectives for this coding challenge**
- We would like to see how you structure your code in React and how you code in React.
- We would like to see if you are able to work with json data, create your own responsive design.
- Most importantly, we would like you to have fun doing it!
